### [Global market share smartphone operating systems of unit shipments 2014-2023](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272307/market-share-forecast-for-smartphone-operating-systems/#statisticTitle)

Smartphones running the Android operating system hold an 87 percent share of the global market in 2019 and this is expected to increase over the forthcoming years. The mobile operating system developed by Apple (iOS) has a 13 percent share of the market.

__How Android became the market leader__

Android’s global success can in many ways be attributed to its open-source software that can be installed on all smartphone devices for free. Developed by Google, the open code provides manufacturers the freedom to choose which apps are pre-installed on their devices, and they can customize layouts to create unique experiences for users. The first commercial version of the Android software was released in 2008 and its rise to market leader was almost instant. The platform held a four percent share of the global operating systems’ market in 2009, but this figure increased by around 20 percent each year for the next three years.

__The global smartphone market__

Annual sales of smartphones have increased to around 1.56 billion units worldwide. They are now available to everyone and not just those with wealth. The cost of buying a smartphone has continued to fall each year, with the global average price now being around 215 U.S. dollars. Fierce competition within the smartphone market could be one reason why prices are falling. Samsung (South Korea) and Apple (U.S.) have historically held large shares of global smartphone production, but Chinese brands Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo are now offering alternative devices that are proving popular worldwide.

The Android operating system (OS) is vast, with different screen sizes, resolutions, and capabilities ranging across versions and devices. The list of versions which the system supports (including updates) is much bigger than that of iOS.

As of 2017, 85.2% of the global market share has an Android core powering it. As the demand for Android OS continues to grow in comparison with other operating systems, so does the awareness among developers that all apps need to be sufficiently tested before they are released.
